# Mortgage-Project
This project explores mortgage attributes at the state-level to identify the most attractive states to open a new mortgage lending business in. 
It also produces a linear interest rate model based on characteristics of specific mortgages using both backward and forward selection to minimize 
prediction error and variance inflation factors to identify and eliminate variables that introduce a high degree of multicollinearity.

Results are presented in Presentation.pdf.
